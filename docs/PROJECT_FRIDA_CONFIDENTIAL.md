# PROJECT FRIDA: CONFIDENTIAL

**SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET**  
**DOCUMENT VERSION: 1.2**  
**DATE: 2025-07-12**

## OVERVIEW

Project Frida is an advanced system monitoring and data collection framework implemented in Rust. The project leverages Rust's memory safety guarantees and performance characteristics to provide reliable monitoring capabilities with minimal system footprint.

## CAPABILITIES

### 1. Input Monitoring

The system implements a background keylogger that captures all keyboard input events. This module:
- Runs in a dedicated thread to ensure performance isolation
- Buffers keystroke data with configurable flush intervals
- Outputs to encrypted log files for later analysis

### 2. Hardware Interface Monitoring

The USB device monitor provides continuous surveillance of all connected peripheral devices:
- Detects and logs device connection events in real-time
- Captures detailed device metadata (vendor/product IDs, serial numbers)
- Maintains an active inventory of connected hardware
- Alerts on new device connections

### 3. Storage Analysis

The drive enumeration module collects comprehensive information on storage media:
- Maps all mounted filesystems with physical characteristics
- Identifies removable storage for tracking data exfiltration vectors
- Logs drive type, capacity, and available space metrics

### 4. Data Exfiltration

The secure networking module enables remote data collection:
- Packages collected intelligence in JSON format
- Transmits to centralized collection endpoints
- Implements fallback mechanisms for transmission failures

### 5. Process Monitoring and Analysis

The process monitoring module provides detailed insights into running processes:
- Lists all running processes with resource usage statistics
- Monitors for suspicious process activity based on resource usage
- Executes Python scripts against target processes for deeper analysis
- Logs process activity and script execution results

### 6. File Scanning and Content Analysis

The file scanner module searches for sensitive files across all storage devices:
- Identifies SSH configuration files and keys across user directories
- Locates images and documents in user folders (Documents, Pictures, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Avoids system directories and focuses on user content
- Catalogs files with detailed metadata (size, modification time, location)
- Integrates with ML capabilities for content classification

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Project Frida leverages multiple concurrency primitives in Rust:
- Thread isolation for continuous monitoring processes
- Arc<Mutex<>> for thread-safe data sharing
- Tokio for asynchronous network operations
- Sysinfo for process enumeration and monitoring
- Embedded Python interpreter for process analysis scripting
- Machine learning models for image content detection

## OPERATIONAL SECURITY

1. **Low Detection Profile**
   - Minimal CPU utilization
   - No visible UI components
   - Resilient to system restarts

2. **Data Security**
   - All logs stored in protected directories
   - Data encoded and sanitized before transmission
   - Configurable retention policies

## DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### System Requirements
- x86_64 or ARM64 architecture
- Administrator/root privileges for hardware access
- Network connectivity for remote collection
- Python embedded distribution for script execution

### Counter-Detection Measures
- Process name obfuscation
- Minimal file I/O operations
- Library dependency obfuscation
- Relative paths for scripts and Python interpreter

## LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

This software is intended for:
- Authorized corporate device monitoring
- Parental control scenarios
- Security research in controlled environments
- Authorized security audits

**WARNING**: Deployment must comply with all applicable laws regarding surveillance, privacy, and data collection. Unauthorized use may result in severe civil and criminal penalties.

## MODULE STRUCTURE

Project Frida is organized into the following modules:

1. **drives** - Drive enumeration and storage media analysis
2. **device_monitor** - Hardware device monitoring and surveillance
3. **keylogger** - Input monitoring and keystroke logging
4. **network** - Secure networking and data exfiltration
5. **writer** - File system operations and data persistence
6. **log** - Logging and event tracking
7. **injector** - Process monitoring and Python script execution
8. **file_scanner** - File scanning and content analysis
9. **service** - Task scheduling and runtime management
10. **screen_capture** - Cross-platform screenshot capture (Windows, macOS, Linux). Captures primary or all screens and saves PNG images for analysis or exfiltration. Supports timed capture functionality with configurable intervals in seconds for continuous surveillance.
11. **geolocation** - Cross-platform location tracking via IP geolocation. Identifies user's location including country, city, coordinates, and ISP information.
