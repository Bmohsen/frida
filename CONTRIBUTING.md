## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/frida_rust.git
   cd frida_rust

Add the upstream remote:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/frida_rust.git

Create a branch for your work:
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name


Development Workflow


Keep your branch updated with the main repository:

git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages:

git commit -m "Add feature: description of feature"

Push your branch to your fork:

git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

Create a Pull Request from your fork to the main repository



Coding Standards

Rust Code Guidelines


Follow the Rust API Guidelines

Use rustfmt to format your code: cargo fmt

Run clippy to catch common mistakes: cargo clippy

Write documentation for public APIs

Follow memory safety best practices

Prefer strong typing over runtime checks

Use error handling rather than panicking where appropriate


File Organization


Organize code into modules based on functionality

Keep files focused on a single responsibility

Place tests in a tests directory or in test modules


Security Considerations

Given the nature of this project, security is paramount:


Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys or credentials

Use secure cryptographic practices

Consider the security implications of every change

Document security considerations in your code

Report security vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers


Pull Request Process


Ensure your code meets the project's coding standards

Update documentation as needed

Add tests for new functionality

Make sure all tests pass: cargo test

Update the README.md with details of significant changes if applicable

Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers who may request changes

Once approved, your PR will be merged


Documentation


Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments

Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

Include examples in documentation where helpful

Update relevant parts of README.md if your changes affect user-facing behavior


Testing


Write unit tests for new functionality

Ensure existing tests pass with your changes

Consider adding integration tests for complex features

For security-sensitive features, include tests that verify security properties
