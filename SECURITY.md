# Security Policy for Project FRIDA

This document outlines the security posture, legal considerations, and responsible use guidelines for Project FRIDA.

## **1. Legal and Ethical Use**

**⚠️ WARNING: This is a powerful tool intended for use by authorized security professionals and researchers only.**

Project FRIDA is a "dual-use" tool. It is designed for legitimate purposes such as adversary simulation, security research, and testing defensive controls. Unauthorized use of this software to access computer systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is **illegal** in most jurisdictions and is strictly forbidden by the terms of the license.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use of this software complies with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws. The developers of Project FRIDA assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program.

## **2. Responsible Use Guidelines**

As an operator of Project FRIDA, you are responsible for its ethical and secure use. We recommend the following:

- **Maintain Authorization**: Always ensure you have explicit, written permission from the target system owner before deploying the agent.
- **Secure Your Infrastructure**: The command and control (C2) server and any collected data must be properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data that is strictly necessary for your authorized engagement.
- **Secure Data Handling**: All sensitive data collected during an engagement must be handled securely, encrypted at rest and in transit, and disposed of properly at the end of the engagement.

## **3. Reporting a Security Vulnerability**

We take the security of our tool seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Project FRIDA itself (e.g., a flaw in the agent or C2 server), please report it to us.

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

- **Email**: `security@example.com` (replace with your actual security contact)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work to resolve the issue promptly.
